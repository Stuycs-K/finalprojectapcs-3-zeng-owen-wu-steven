# Project Description

We will be making a clone of Minesweeper, with all of the basic mechanics. This includes flagging tiles, revealing tiles, board generation, and chording. We will also be adding additional features, like drawing on the board, hints, allowing user to select difficulty(mine count/board size). We also include variants, which mean that the clues(numbers on tiles) will be modified, or rules for board generation, and other modifications that would make the game harder beyond modifying mine count and board size. 

# Intended usage:

The user will be prompted to select a difficulty, which determines how large the board is, and the amount of mines. The user will also be allowed to select which variants they wish to play on. They will then be shown a board of tiles that they will solve.
